### Typing...

For my whole life, I was told that I typed really fast (I averaged about 45 WPM). In 2018, I stumbled upon a really cool video about fast typing. It showed someone typing at around 150 WPM, so I decided to check my own speed. It turned out to be close to 50 WPM, which left me feeling disappointed. I tried to improve, but I couldn't, so I gave up.

Then, in 2023, I came across another video of someone typing really fast. I did a typing test and I was typing 60 WPM using only 3–6 fingers. I started practicing on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) with 10 fingers, and after a while, I was typing at a whopping 15 WPM. After a few days, my speed increased to about 30–40 WPM. Now, after a year, I can type around 80–100 WPM (I would type faster, but I stopped practicing after a few weeks).

Of course, these typing tests don't show your real typing speed, because most of the time, when you're typing on your keyboard, you know the text you're typing, rather than just copying what you see on the screen.

### What's the point of this post?

You should spend some time practicing typing, especially if you're a software engineer, programmer, or anyone whose job requires a lot of typing.

I’ve noticed more and more people typing at around 20 WPM, when with just a few days of practice, they could easily type 50 WPM. It doesn’t take much effort, but it saves a ton of time in the long run.

**Higher typing speed = less time wasted typing**

### How do I type faster?

1. Test your typing speed on sites like [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/), [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/), [10FastFingers](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english), or [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/).
2. Record yourself typing to check if you’re using a [proper finger position](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=proper+finger+position+on+keyboard&t=h_&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images).
3. Making fewer mistakes is more important than typing faster. When you make a mistake, you have to go back and fix it, which disrupts your flow and slows you down.
4. Practice.
