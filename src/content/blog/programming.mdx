# How do I start programming?

Idk. I've never asked myself this question, because I didn't need to. I started programming to solve problems that I had. My first time "programming" was a few years ago when I saw a YouTube video about command blocks and It hooked me instantly I've always loved math and problem solving. Command blocks were problems that had an effect in minecraft when I "solved" them and I build a ton of stuff with them. A few years later I asked myself "How do I create websites" and I just started learning.

# What should I learn?

LEARN GIT. What is git? Git is a version control system. What's that? - just google it. After you've learned the basics of git ( add, commit, push ) choose a random programming language to learn and learn basic syntax. Try not to memorize the syntax. What do I mean by "memorizing the syntax"? - I'm trying to say that you should try to think logically. Programming isn't about syntax Its about the algorithms and solutions. Don't focus on the language focus on the solution.

# OK and how do I start learning?

Just find a problem to solve and try solve It. Try to think about something interesting and try to build it `but I don't know how...` - just google it, there are so many tutorials on YouTube and on other websites.

# What should i build?

- discord bot
- website
- blog
- calculator
- to-do app
- timer
- a list of something
- Or anything that sounds interesting.

# How do I learn?

If I started programming today I would focus on learning algorithms and then recreating them in a simple programming language like JavaScript/go/python. Then I would build a small web app that uses these algorithms.

If you want to learn something new, try:

- Searching for tutorials
- Exploring [awesome lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome-list)
- Reading documentation
- Participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
- Studying other people's code
- working on personal projects
- talking with people that can code
