# Why would you buy a laptop?

There are many reasons why you could buy a laptop. I bought one because I live in a dorm and I don't want to take my desktop home every single weekend.

# What laptop should I buy?

Idk do some research.

# What os should i use?

windows.
Or if you're a nerd you can use Linux or any other os.

# What do you use?

Why do you care? Even if i told you you would still use something else. How do I know that? Because I did the same thing. After watching a bunch of YouTube videos I still bought the same laptop that I decided to buy after watching one video. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't do your own research. Everyone has different needs. I just liked this one and It fits my needs.

# What's the point of this blog post?

The point is that you should do your own research and buy yourself the laptop you like the most.
I recommend:

- Watching YouTube videos
- Reading reddit posts
- Reading blog posts
- Comparing specs ( especially the battery )
