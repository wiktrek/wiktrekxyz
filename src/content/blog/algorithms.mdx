# Learning algorithms

'm making this blog post to motivate myself to learn algorithms and data structures. I will be updating it in the future about my progress.

# Where do I learn?

- LeetCode
- [LeetCode study plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/)
- Codeforces
- Youtube
- AI

# What did I learn?

That I need to spend more time programming. Because I spent like 20h programming since june and Its almost september.

Update (15.09.2025): I have been doing some problems on LeetCode. I can solve easy problems with little to no help.



This is it for now I don't know what else to write here.
