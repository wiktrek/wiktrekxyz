# I lost motivation to code

This year i made 5x less commits than I made in 2023 and the worst part is that I don't know why. I haven't made any new private projects that would make my commit amount go down and I still enjoy programming as much as I did before.

# What I did instead of coding?

### Good things I did

- I learned how to type properly
- Solved a bunch of coding problems
- Made some small changes to my projects

### Worse things I did

- Watched a bunch of coding videos instead of coding

# Blogging?

I decided that I'll start documenting my journey. I don't think that anyone will read it but It makes me wanna code.

# What I changed while writing this blog post

- [Changed navbar on my website](https://github.com/wiktrek/wiktrekxyz/commit/186019954b0193157f120aef6692aacc13a8937a)
- Wrote [another blog post](https://wiktrek.xyz/blog/laptop)

# Why The update?

- I want to code again.
- I've changed some things in my projects and I've started a few cool projects including [this one](https://github.com/wiktrek/selfhosted).
- I finally switched to linux (I should make a blog post about it). I use arch btw.
- I built 2 programming projects with my friends.

# The reason why I lost motivation

In 2023 I've learned a ton of stuff about programming, computers, etc. I had a ton of time that I could spend programming.

In 2024 I ran out of ideas and I didn't know what to build. In september I switched to a new school to study programming.
This means that I now live in a dorm for 5 days a week. Although I have a laptop, I can't get myself to code there, leaving
me with 2 days for programming.

In 2025 I'm still in that same school and I love it here. I've started programming more after school.

    I have a ton of time after school because I'm too lazy to study (hopefully,
    I will study more in the future)

# My takeaway from this

I've put more time into different activities than programming, but I still enjoy and love programming.
This does't mean that I wasn't thinking about solving problems 24/7 - I still was, and probably will be.

I will probably make an update to this post in the future...
