# I lost motivation to code

This year i made 5x less commits than I made in 2023 and the worst part is that I don't know why. I haven't made any new private projects that would make my commit amount go down and I still enjoy programming as much as I did before.

# What I did instead of coding?

### Good things I did

- I learned how to type properly
- Solved a bunch of coding problems
- Made some small changes to my projects

### Worse things I did

- Watched a bunch of coding videos instead of coding

# Blogging?

I decided that I'll start documenting my journey. I don't think that anyone will read it but It makes me wanna code.

# What I changed while writing this blog post
